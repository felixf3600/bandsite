\*\*\*\* MIXINS
Created mixins for fonts and display flex as well as media queries that is used a lot.

\*\*\* DIGGING DEEPER

\*\*\*\* NAVIGATION EFFECTS
I have added some animation to the nav links. The links will change color while its hovering. Did not apply the background changes from the examples as I did not think it would look good. Used a media query to make sure you can hover for this to take effect

\*\*\*\* GALLERY EFFECTS
I have grayed out the photos and it will show fulll colors on hover. I have also attached this to a media query so that it will only work on devices that can hover. Otherwise the photos will show in full color and these effects wont show.

\*\*\*\* MAILTO
I have incorporated mailto for the links. if clicked it will open your preffered email program with the link.
